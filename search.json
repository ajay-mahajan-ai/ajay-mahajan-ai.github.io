    "text": "Project Python Foundations: FoodHub Data Analysis\n\nContext\nThe number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.\nThe app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer’s location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants.\n\n\nObjective\nThe food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.\n\n\nData Description\nThe data contains the different data related to a food order. The detailed data dictionary is given below.\n\n\nData Dictionary\n\norder_id: Unique ID of the order\ncustomer_id: ID of the customer who ordered the food\nrestaurant_name: Name of the restaurant\ncuisine_type: Cuisine ordered by the customer\ncost_of_the_order: Cost of the order\nday_of_the_week: Indicates whether the order is placed on a weekday or weekend (The weekday is from Monday to Friday and the weekend is Saturday and Sunday)\nrating: Rating given by the customer out of 5\nfood_preparation_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the restaurant to prepare the food. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the restaurant’s order confirmation and the delivery person’s pick-up confirmation.\ndelivery_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the delivery person to deliver the food package. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the delivery person’s pick-up confirmation and drop-off information\n\n\n\nLet us start by importing the required libraries\n\n# Installing the libraries with the specified version.\n!pip install numpy==1.25.2 pandas==1.5.3 matplotlib==3.7.1 seaborn==0.13.1 -q --user\n\nNote: After running the above cell, kindly restart the notebook kernel and run all cells sequentially from the start again.\n\n# import libraries for data manipulation\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# import libraries for data visualization\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the structure of the data\n\n# uncomment and run the following lines for Google Colab\nfrom google.colab import drive\ndrive.mount('/content/drive')\n\nDrive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n\n\n\n# Reading data in df_orig and creating a copy for analysis\ndf_orig = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/foodhub_order.csv')\ndf = df_orig.copy()\n\n\n# Write your code here to view the first 5 rows\n\n# By default df.head() returns first 5 rows\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\norder_id\ncustomer_id\nrestaurant_name\ncuisine_type\ncost_of_the_order\nday_of_the_week\nrating\nfood_preparation_time\ndelivery_time\n\n\n\n\n0\n1477147\n337525\nHangawi\nKorean\n30.75\nWeekend\nNot given\n25\n20\n\n\n1\n1477685\n358141\nBlue Ribbon Sushi Izakaya\nJapanese\n12.08\nWeekend\nNot given\n25\n23\n\n\n2\n1477070\n66393\nCafe Habana\nMexican\n12.23\nWeekday\n5\n23\n28\n\n\n3\n1477334\n106968\nBlue Ribbon Fried Chicken\nAmerican\n29.20\nWeekend\n3\n25\n15\n\n\n4\n1478249\n76942\nDirty Bird to Go\nAmerican\n11.59\nWeekday\n4\n25\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1: How many rows and columns are present in the data?

Taking this attribute into account, we can augment the images using the techniques listed below\n\nHorizontal Flip (should be set to True/False)\nVertical Flip (should be set to True/False)\nHeight Shift (should be between 0 and 1)\nWidth Shift (should be between 0 and 1)\nRotation (should be between 0 and 180)\nShear (should be between 0 and 1)\nZoom (should be between 0 and 1) etc.\n\n\nRemember, data augmentation should not be used in the validation/test data set.\n\nmodel_4 = Sequential()\n\n# Adding the convolutional part of the VGG16 model from above\nmodel_4.add(vgg_model)\n\n# Flattening the output of the VGG16 model because it is from a convolutional layer\nmodel_4.add(Flatten())\n\n#Adding the Feed Forward neural network\nmodel_4.add(Dense(256, activation='relu'))\nmodel_4.add(Dropout(0.5))\nmodel_4.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))\n\n# Adding a dense output layer\nmodel_4.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n\nopt = Adam(learning_rate=0.0001)\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel_4.compile(optimizer=opt,loss=keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Generating the summary of the model\nmodel_4.summary()\n\nModel: \"sequential_7\"\n\n\n\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓\n┃ Layer (type)                    ┃ Output Shape           ┃       Param # ┃\n┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩\n│ vgg16 (Functional)              │ (None, 6, 6, 512)      │    14,714,688 │\n├─────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┼───────────────┤\n│ flatten_7 (Flatten)             │ (None, 18432)          │             0 │\n├─────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┼───────────────┤\n│ dense_14 (Dense)                │ (None, 256)            │     4,718,848 │\n├─────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┼───────────────┤\n│ dropout_1 (Dropout)             │ (None, 256)            │             0 │\n├─────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┼───────────────┤\n│ dense_15 (Dense)                │ (None, 128)            │        32,896 │\n├─────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┼───────────────┤\n│ dense_16 (Dense)                │ (None, 1)              │           129 │\n└─────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┴───────────────┘\n\n\n\n Total params: 19,466,561 (74.26 MB)\n\n\n\n Trainable params: 4,751,873 (18.13 MB)\n\n\n\n Non-trainable params: 14,714,688 (56.13 MB)\n\n\n\n\n# Applying data augmentation\ntrain_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(\n    horizontal_flip=True,\n    vertical_flip=True,\n    height_shift_range=0.2,\n    width_shift_range=0.2,\n    rotation_range=20,\n    shear_range=0.2,\n    zoom_range=0.2\n)\n\n\nhistory_4 = model_4.fit(train_datagen.flow(X_train_norm, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, seed=42,\n                        shuffle=False),epochs=epochs,\n                        steps_per_epoch=X_train_norm.shape[0],\n                        validation_data=(X_val_norm, y_val),verbose=1)\n\n\nEpoch 1/10\n\n441/441 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 9s 13ms/step -

    "text": "The healthcare industry is rapidly evolving, with professionals facing increasing challenges in managing vast volumes of medical data while delivering accurate and timely diagnoses. The need for quick access to comprehensive, reliable, and up-to-date medical knowledge is critical for improving patient outcomes and ensuring informed decision-making in a fast-paced environment.\nHealthcare professionals often encounter information overload, struggling to sift through extensive research and data to create accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. This challenge is amplified by the need for efficiency, particularly in emergencies, where time-sensitive decisions are vital. Furthermore, access to trusted, current medical information from renowned manuals and research papers is essential for maintaining high standards of care.\nTo address these challenges, healthcare centers can focus on integrating systems that streamline access to medical knowledge, provide tools to support quick decision-making, and enhance efficiency.

    "text": "The healthcare industry is rapidly evolving, with professionals facing increasing challenges in managing vast volumes of medical data while delivering accurate and timely diagnoses. The need for quick access to comprehensive, reliable, and up-to-date medical knowledge is critical for improving patient outcomes and ensuring informed decision-making in a fast-paced environment.\nHealthcare professionals often encounter information overload, struggling to sift through extensive research and data to create accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. This challenge is amplified by the need for efficiency, particularly in emergencies, where time-sensitive decisions are vital. Furthermore, access to trusted, current medical information from renowned manuals and research papers is essential for maintaining high standards of care.\nTo address these challenges, healthcare centers can focus on integrating systems that streamline access to medical knowledge, provide tools to support quick decision-making, and enhance efficiency.

The management of sepsis in a critical care unit (CCU) requires a systematic approach that includes early recognition, prompt treatment, and ongoing monitoring. Here is a general protocol for managing sepsis in a CCU:\\n\\n1. Early recognition:\\n\\t* Use a standardized screening tool, such as the Sepsis-3 definition, to identify patients who are at risk of developing sepsis.\\n\\t* Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered mental status.\\n2. Initial assessment:\\n\\t* Perform a thorough physical examination to identify any signs of infection or organ dysfunction.\\n\\t* Order blood cultures and other diagnostic tests (such as complete blood count, electrolytes, and renal function tests) to confirm the diagnosis of sepsis.\\n3. Resuscitation:\\n\\t* Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics within the first hour of recognition of sepsis, and continue until the patient is stable or the source of infection has been identified and treated.\\n\\t* Provide fluid resuscitation with crystalloids or colloids as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg.\\n\\t* Consider vasopressor therapy if MAP &lt; 65 mmHg despite fluid resuscitation.\\n4. Source control:\\n\\t* Identify and treat the source of infection, such as a urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or bloodstream infection.\\n\\t* Consider surgical intervention if the source of infection is a abscess or infected tissue.\\n5. Supportive care:\\n\\t* Provide mechanical ventilation if the patient requires respiratory support.\\n\\t* Manage hypotension with vasopressor therapy and fluid resuscitation as needed.\\n\\t* Monitor and manage electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia or hypocalcemia.\\n6. Monitoring:\\n\\t* Continuously monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, tachycardia\"\n\n\n\n\nQuery 2: What are the common symptoms for appendicitis, and can it be cured via medicine?

The most common symptoms of appendicitis include:\\n\\n1. Severe pain in the abdomen, usually starting near the belly button and then moving to the lower right side of the abdomen.\\n2. Nausea and vomiting.\\n3. Loss of appetite.\\n4. Fever.\\n5. Abdominal tenderness and guarding (muscle tension).\\n6. Abdominal swelling.\\n7. Diarrhea or constipation.\\n\\nIf you suspect that you or someone else may have appendicitis, it is essential to seek medical attention immediately. Appendicitis can be cured via surgery, but not with medicine. In fact, delaying treatment can lead to serious complications, such as the appendix rupturing and spreading infection throughout the abdominal cavity.\\n\\nThe surgical procedure used to treat appendicitis is called an appendectomy. There are two types of appendectomies: open and laparoscopic.\\n\\n1. Open Appendectomy: This is the traditional method, where a single incision is made in the lower right abdomen to remove the inflamed appendix. The wound is then closed with sutures or staples.\\n2. Laparoscopic Appendectomy: This is a less invasive procedure, where several small incisions are made in the abdomen, and a laparoscope (a thin tube with a camera and light) is inserted to visualize the appendix. The inflamed appendix is then removed through one of the small incisions.\\n\\nBoth procedures are usually performed under general anesthesia, and the patient can expect to stay in the hospital for a few days after surgery. In some cases, the surgeon may decide to perform an open appendectomy if the appendix has already ruptured or if there are other complications present.\\n\\nIt is important to note that while antibiotics may be given to treat any underlying infection, they cannot cure appendicitis. Only surgical removal of the inflamed appendix can effectively treat the condition.'\n\n\n\n\nQuery 3: What are the effective treatments or solutions for addressing sudden patchy hair loss, commonly seen as localized bald spots on the scalp, and what could be the possible causes behind it?\n\nuser_prompt = \"What are the effective treatments or solutions for addressing sudden patchy hair loss, commonly seen as localized bald spots on the scalp, and what could be the possible causes behind it?\"\nresponse(user_prompt)\n\nLlama.generate: prefix-match hit\n\nllama_print_timings:        load time =    1761.86 ms\nllama_print_timings:      sample time =     322.16 ms /   512 runs   (    0.63 ms per token,  1589.28 tokens per second)\nllama_print_timings: prompt eval time =     247.18 ms /    37 tokens (    6.68 ms per token,   149.69 tokens per second)\nllama_print_timings:        eval time =   16779.47 ms /   511 runs   (   32.84 ms per token,    30.45 tokens per second)\nllama_print_timings:       total time =   17860.28 ms /   548 tokens\n\n\n\"\\nSudden patchy hair loss, also known as alopecia areata, can be caused by a variety of factors. Here are some effective treatments and solutions for addressing this condition:\\n\\n1. Corticosteroid injections: These injections can help suppress the immune system and promote hair growth. They are usually given every 4-6 weeks and can be effective in promoting hair regrowth.\\n2. Topical corticosteroids: Over-the-counter or prescription topical corticosteroids can be applied directly to the affected area to reduce inflammation and promote hair growth.\\n3. Minoxidil (Rogaine): This is a solution that is applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth. It is available over-the-counter and can be effective in promoting hair regrowth.\\n4. Anthralin: This is a medication that is applied to the skin to reduce inflammation and promote hair growth. It is often used in combination with corticosteroids.\\n5. Phototherapy: Exposure to specific wavelengths of light, such as ultraviolet B (UVB) or narrowband UVB, can help reduce inflammation and promote hair growth.\\n6. Immunotherapy: This involves using medications to suppress the immune system and promote hair growth. One common treatment is diphencyprone (DPCP), which causes a mild allergic reaction that leads to hair growth.\\n7. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy: This involves injecting platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the affected area to stimulate hair growth. PRP is derived from the patient's own blood and contains growth factors that promote hair growth.\\n8. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT): This involves using a low-level laser or light-emitting device to stimulate hair growth.

The protocol for managing sepsis in a critical care unit involves early recognition, prompt administration of antibiotics and supportive care, and careful monitoring of vital signs and organ function.\nCauses and Risk Factors\nSepsis can be caused by any type of infection, but common culprits include pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections. Risk factors for developing sepsis include age over 65, weakened immune system, recent surgery or invasive medical procedure, and underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney disease.\nSymptoms\nEarly signs of sepsis can be subtle and may progress rapidly. Key symptoms to watch for include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, confusion, and decreased urine output. As sepsis worsens, patients may develop septic shock, organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\nDiagnosis\nSepsis is diagnosed based on clinical presentation, laboratory values, and imaging studies. The Sepsis-3 definition requires the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and organ dysfunction. SIRS criteria include body temperature &gt;38Â°C or &lt;36Â°C, heart rate &gt;90 beats per minute, respiratory rate &gt;20 breaths per minute, or white blood cell count &gt;12,000 cells/mm3 or &lt;4,000 cells/mm3.\nTreatment and Recovery\nEarly recognition and administration of antibiotics are critical for effective sepsis management. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered within the first hour of diagnosis, ideally via central venous catheter. Supportive care includes mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and fluid resuscitation as needed.\nTreatment Options\nMedical options for sepsis management include:\n\nAntibiotics: Broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against common causes of sepsis, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\nVasopressors: To maintain mean arterial pressure â¥65 mmHg and prevent hypotension.\nMechanical ventilation: As needed to support respiratory function.\nFluid resuscitation: With isotonic fluids to maintain urine output and prevent hypovolemia.\n\nSurgical options for sepsis management include:\n\nSource control: Surgical debridement or removal of the infected focus, such as a abscess or infected tissue.\nVascular access: Placement of central venous catheters or arterial lines for fluid resuscitation and monitoring.\nThoracotomy: For severe respiratory failure refractory to medical management.\n\nRecovery and Follow-Up\nSepsis recovery is a complex process that requires careful monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and organ function. Patients may require prolonged hospitalization and rehabilitation to regain lost strength and function. Follow-up care should include regular check-ups with a primary care physician and specialists as needed.\nIn conclusion, the protocol for managing sepsis in a critical care unit involves early recognition, prompt administration of antibiotics and supportive care, and careful monitoring of vital signs and organ function. Prompt treatment and close monitoring can significantly improve outcomes for patients with sepsis.\n\n\n\n\nQuery 2: What are the common symptoms for appendicitis, and can it be cured via medicine?

Some Causes of Agitation or Confusion in Critical Care Patients]\\nPast medical history is reviewed for potential causes. Underlying liver disease suggests possible hepatic\\nencephalopathy. Known substance dependency or abuse suggests a withdrawal syndrome.\\nAwake, coherent patients are asked what is troubling them and are questioned specifically about pain,\\ndyspnea, and previously unreported substance dependency.\\nPhysical examination: O2 saturation &lt; 90% suggests a hypoxic etiology. Low BP and urine output\\nsuggest CNS hypoperfusion. Fever and tachycardia suggest sepsis or delirium tremens. Neck stiffness\\nsuggests meningitis, although this finding may be difficult to demonstrate in an agitated patient. Focal\\nfindings on neurologic examination suggest stroke, hemorrhage, or increased intracranial pressure (ICP).\\nThe degree of agitation can be quantified using a scale such as the Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale (see\\nTable 222-9) or the Ramsay Sedation Scale. Use of such scales allows better consistency between\\nobservers and the identification of trends.

It is\\ntypically necessary to allow paralysis to wear off periodically (eg, daily) so that the patient can be\\nassessed.\\nTesting: Identified abnormalities (eg, hypoxia, hypotension, fever) should be clarified further with\\nappropriate testing. Head CT need not routinely be done unless focal neurologic findings are present or\\nno other etiology is found. A bispectral index (BIS) monitor may be helpful in determining the level of\\nsedation/agitation of patients under neuromuscular blockade.\\nTreatment\\nUnderlying conditions (eg, hypoxia, shock, drugs) should be addressed. The environment should be\\noptimized (eg, darkness, quiet, and minimal sleep interruption at night) as much as is compatible with\\nmedical care. Clocks, calendars, outside windows, and TV or radio programs also help connect the\\npatient with the world, lessening confusion. Family presence and consistent nursing personnel may be\\ncalming.\\nDrug treatment is dictated by the most vexing symptoms. Pain is treated with analgesics; anxiety and\\ninsomnia are treated with sedatives; and psychosis and delirium are treated with small doses of an\\nantipsychotic drug. Intubation may be needed when sedative and analgesic requirements are high\\nenough to jeopardize the airway or respiratory drive. Many drugs are available; generally, short-acting\\ndrugs are preferred for patients who need frequent neurologic examination or who are being weaned to\\nextubation.\\nAnalgesia: Pain should be treated with appropriate doses of IV opioids; conscious patients with painful\\nconditions (eg, fractures, surgical incisions) who are unable to communicate should be assumed to have\\npain and receive analgesics accordingly. Mechanical ventilation is somewhat uncomfortable, and patients\\ngenerally should receive a combination of opioid and amnestic sedative drugs. Fentanyl is the opioid of\\nchoice because of its potency, short duration of action, and minimal cardiovascular effects. A common\\nregimen can be 30 to 100 μg/h of fentanyl; individual requirements are highly variable.\\nSedation: Despite analgesia, many patients remain sufficiently agitated as to require sedation. A\\nsedative can also provide\\n[Table 222-9. Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale]'\n\n\n\ndocument_chunks[5002].page_content\n\n'[Table 222-9. Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale]\\npatient comfort at a lower dose of analgesic. Benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, midazolam) are most\\ncommon, but propofol, a sedative-hypnotic drug, may be used. A common regimen for sedation is\\nlorazepam 1 to 2 mg IV q 1 to 2 h or a continuous infusion at 1 to 2 mg/h if the patient is intubated. These\\ndrugs pose risks of respiratory depression, hypotension, delirium, and prolonged physiologic effects in\\nsome patients. Long-acting benzodiazepines such as diazepam, flurazepam, and chlordiazepoxide should\\nbe avoided in the elderly. Antipsychotics with less anticholinergic effect, such as haloperidol 1 to 3 mg IV,\\nmay work best when combined with benzodiazepines.\\nNeuromuscular blockade: For intubated patients, neuromuscular blockade is not a substitute for\\nsedation; it only removes visible manifestations of the problem (agitation) without correcting it. However,\\nneuromuscular blockade may be required during tests (eg CT, MRI) or procedures (eg, central line\\nplacement) that require patients to be motionless or in patients who cannot be ventilated despite\\nadequate analgesia and sedation. Prolonged neuromuscular blockade should be avoided unless patients\\nhave severe lung injury and cannot do the work of breathing safely. Use for &gt; 1 to 2 days may lead to\\nprolonged weakness, particularly when corticosteroids are concomitantly given. Common regimens\\ninclude vecuronium (continuous infusion as directed by stimulation).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 222.

Cardiac Arrest\\nIntroduction\\nCardiac arrest is the terminal event in any fatal disorder. It may also occur suddenly (defined as within 24\\nh of onset of symptoms in a previously functioning person) and, as such, occurs outside the hospital in\\nabout 400,000 people/yr in the US, with a 90% mortality.\\nRespiratory arrest and cardiac arrest are distinct, but without treatment, one inevitably leads to the other.\\n(See also respiratory failure in Ch. 225, dyspnea on p. 1832, and hypoxia on p. 2250.)\\nEtiology\\nIn adults, sudden cardiac arrest results primarily from cardiac disease (of all types, but especially\\ncoronary artery disease). In a significant percentage of patients, sudden cardiac arrest is the first\\nmanifestation of heart disease. Other causes include circulatory shock due to noncardiac disorders\\n(especially pulmonary embolism, GI hemorrhage, or trauma), ventilatory failure, and metabolic disturbance\\n(including drug overdose).\\nIn children, cardiac causes of sudden cardiac arrest are much less common (&lt; 15 to 20%). Instead,\\npredominant causes include trauma, poisoning, and various respiratory disorders (eg, airway obstruction,\\nsmoke inhalation, drowning, infection, sudden infant death syndrome).\\nPathophysiology\\nCardiac arrest causes global ischemia with consequences at the cellular level that adversely affect organ\\nfunction after resuscitation. The main consequences involve direct cellular damage and edema formation.\\nEdema is particularly harmful in the brain, which has minimal room to expand, and often results in\\nincreased intracranial pressure and corresponding decreased cerebral perfusion postresuscitation. A\\nsignificant proportion of successfully resuscitated patients have short-term or long-term cerebral\\ndysfunction manifested by altered alertness (from mild confusion to coma), seizures, or both.\\nDecreased ATP production leads to loss of membrane integrity with efflux of K and influx of Na and Ca.\\nExcess Na causes cellular edema. Excess Ca damages mitochondria (depressing ATP production),\\nincreases nitric oxide production (leading to formation of damaging free radicals), and, in certain\\ncircumstances, activates proteases that further damage cells.\\nAbnormal ion flux also results in depolarization of neurons, releasing neurotransmitters, some of which'\n\n\n\n\nEmbedding\n\nembedding_model = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(model_name='thenlper/gte-large')\n\n\nembedding_1 = embedding_model.embed_query(document_chunks[0].page_content)\nembedding_2 = embedding_model.embed_query(document_chunks[1].page_content)\n\n\nprint(\"Dimension of the embedding vector \",len(embedding_1))\nlen(embedding_1)==len(embedding_2)\n\nDimension of the embedding vector  1024\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\nVector Database\n\nout_dir = 'medical_db'\n\nif not os.path.exists(out_dir):\n    os.makedirs(out_dir)\n\nvectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(\n    documents=document_chunks,\n    embedding=embedding_model,\n    persist_directory=out_dir\n)\n\n\nvectorstore = Chroma(\n    embedding_function=embedding_model,\n    persist_directory=out_dir\n)\n\n\nvectorstore.embeddings\n\nHuggingFaceEmbeddings(client=SentenceTransformer(\n  (0): Transformer({'max_seq_length': 512, 'do_lower_case': False}) with Transformer model: BertModel \n  (1): Pooling({'word_embedding_dimension': 1024, 'pooling_mode_cls_token': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_tokens': True, 'pooling_mode_max_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_sqrt_len_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_weightedmean_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_lasttoken': False, 'include_prompt': True})\n  (2): Normalize()\n), model_name='thenlper/gte-large', cache_folder=None, model_kwargs={}, encode_kwargs={}, multi_process=False, show_progress=False)\n\n\n\nvectorstore.similarity_search(\"symptoms appendicitis?\",k=3)\n\n[Document(metadata={'creationDate': 'D:20120615054440Z', 'trapped': '', 'keywords': '', 'creationdate': '2012-06-15T05:44:40+00:00', 'file_path': '/content/drive/MyDrive/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'moddate': '2025-05-28T15:49:29+00:00', 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition', 'modDate': 'D:20250528154929Z', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'producer': 'pdf-lib (https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib)', 'page': 173, 'total_pages': 4114, 'creator': 'Atop CHM to PDF Converter', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf'}, page_content=\"Etiology\\nAppendicitis is thought to result from obstruction of the appendiceal lumen, typically by lymphoid\\nhyperplasia, but occasionally by a fecalith, foreign body, or even worms.

Here’s the answer based on the provided context:\nSymptoms of Appendicitis:\n\nSudden and severe pain in the abdomen (often near the navel)\nNausea and vomiting\nLoss of appetite\nFever\nAbdominal tenderness and guarding (muscle tension)\n\nCan Appendicitis be Cured via Medicine?\nNo, appendicitis cannot be cured solely with medicine. Antibiotics may be used to treat any secondary infections, but they do not address the underlying inflammation of the appendix. Surgical intervention is necessary to remove the inflamed appendix and prevent further complications.\nSurgical Procedure for Treating Appendicitis:\nThe preferred surgical procedure for treating appendicitis is a laparoscopic appendectomy, which involves removing the inflamed appendix through small incisions in the abdomen. This approach has been shown to have fewer complications and a faster recovery time compared to open appendectomy.\nIf the appendix is perforated, antibiotics may be administered before surgery to help reduce the risk of infection. In some cases, an open appendectomy may be necessary if the appendix is difficult to locate or if there are other complications present.\nIt’s important to note that a negative appendectomy rate of 15% is considered acceptable, meaning that in about 15% of cases, the surgeon may not be able to remove the inflamed appendix due to its location or other factors. In these cases, the patient may require further treatment, such as antibiotics and supportive care, to manage any ongoing infection or inflammation.\n\n\n\n\nQuery 3: What are the effective treatments

Companies in the United States look for hard-working, talented, and qualified individuals both locally as well as abroad.\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of the US permits foreign workers to come to the United States to work on either a temporary or permanent basis. The act also protects US workers against adverse impacts on their wages or working conditions by ensuring US employers’ compliance with statutory requirements when they hire foreign workers to fill workforce shortages. The immigration programs are administered by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC).\nOFLC processes job certification applications for employers seeking to bring foreign workers into the United States and grants certifications in those cases where employers can demonstrate that there are not sufficient US workers available to perform the work at wages that meet or exceed the wage paid for the occupation in the area of intended employment.\n\n\nObjective:\nIn FY 2016, the OFLC processed 775,979 employer applications for 1,699,957 positions for temporary and permanent labor certifications. This was a nine percent increase in the overall number of processed applications from the previous year. The process of reviewing every case is becoming a tedious task as the number of applicants is increasing every year.\nThe increasing number of applicants every year calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in shortlisting the candidates having higher chances of VISA approval. OFLC has hired the firm EasyVisa for data-driven solutions. You as a data scientist at EasyVisa have to analyze the data provided and, with the help of a classification model:\n\nFacilitate the process of visa approvals.\nRecommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status.\n\n\n\nData Description\nThe data contains the different attributes of employee and the employer. The detailed data dictionary is given below.\n\ncase_id: ID of each visa application\ncontinent: Information of continent the employee\neducation_of_employee: Information of education of the employee\nhas_job_experience: Does the employee has any job experience? Y= Yes; N = No\nrequires_job_training: Does the employee require any job training? Y = Yes; N = No\nno_of_employees: Number of employees in the employer’s company\nyr_of_estab: Year in which the employer’s company was established\nregion_of_employment: Information of foreign worker’s intended region of employment in the US.\nprevailing_wage: Average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a specific occupation in the area of intended employment. The purpose of the prevailing wage is to ensure that the foreign worker is not underpaid compared to other workers offering the same or similar service in the same area of employment.\nunit_of_wage: Unit of prevailing wage. Values include Hourly, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly.\nfull_time_position: Is the position of work full-time? Y = Full Time Position; N = Part Time Position\ncase_status: Flag indicating if the Visa was certified or denied"

Let’s find out if education has any impact on visa certification\n\nstacked_barplot(data, \"education_of_employee\", \"case_status\")\n\n\nThe higher the education level, the greater the visa approval rate.\nApplicants with only a High School education face a much higher rejection rate (~65%).\nDoctorate holders have the highest approval rate (~87%), followed closely by Master’s degree applicants.\nThis chart clearly shows that education is a strong predictor of visa certification success.\n\n\n\nLets’ similarly check for the continents and find out how the visa status vary across different continents.\n\nstacked_barplot(data, \"continent\", \"case_status\")\n\n\nEurope and Africa show the highest approval rates, making them favorable continents in terms of visa outcomes.\nAsia and Oceania are more middle-ground, with balanced approval/denial rates.\nSouth America has the lowest certification rate (~58%).\n\n\n\nExperienced professionals might look abroad for opportunities to improve their lifestyles and career development. Let’s see if having work experience has any influence over visa certification\n\nstacked_barplot(data, \"has_job_experience\", \"case_status\")\n\n\nApplicants with job experience are much more likely to be certified (~75%) compared to those without.\nLack of experience increases denial risk, with nearly half of inexperienced applicants getting denied.\n\n\n\nChecking if the prevailing wage is similar across all the regions of the US\n\nsns.boxplot(data=data, x=\"region_of_employment\", y=\"prevailing_wage\")\n\n\nMidwest and Island regions offer the highest median prevailing wages, despite having fewer applicants.\nWest and Northeast, despite being tech hubs, show lower median wages, possibly due to a higher number of entry-level or lower-paying positions.\nAll regions show a large number of outliers, indicating presence of high-paying roles (e.g., tech, specialized roles).\n\n\n\nThe US government has established a prevailing wage to protect local talent and foreign workers. Let’s analyze the data and see if the visa status changes with the prevailing wage\n\ndistribution_plot_wrt_target(data, \"prevailing_wage\", \"case_status\")\n\n\nMost denied cases cluster at lower wages.\nA visible right-skewed distribution — higher wages are rare for denials.\nCertified applications tend to have higher prevailing wages overall.\nThe density peaks around $70,000–$90,000, compared to denials peaking closer to $30,000–$50,000.\n\nWith Outliers * Certified applications have a higher median wage than denied ones. * Certified wages also show a broader upper range, with more high-wage outliers.\nWithout Outliers * Even after removing outliers, Certified cases still have slightly higher median and upper quartile wages, reinforcing the positive relationship between wage and approval likelihood.\nConclusion: * Higher prevailing wage is positively correlated with visa certification. * Applicants with lower wages are more likely to be denied. * Wage can be a strong predictive feature for classification models.\n\n\nThe prevailing wage has different units (Hourly, Weekly, etc). Let’s find out if it has any impact on visa applications getting certified.\n\nstacked_barplot(data, \"unit_of_wage\", \"case_status\")\n\n\nYearly wage entries have the highest certification rates — likely linked to full-time, salaried positions.\nHourly wages show the lowest approval rate (~35%), suggesting that jobs paid by the hour (e.g., part-time or lower-skill roles) may be viewed as less favorable.\nMonthly and weekly wages fall in the middle, with moderate certification rates.\nUnit of wage is a meaningful indicator in visa decision outcomes.\nYearly wage offers the strongest signal for visa success."

    "text": "Problem Statement\n\nContext\nBusinesses like banks which provide service have to worry about problem of ‘Customer Churn’ i.e. customers leaving and joining another service provider. It is important to understand which aspects of the service influence a customer’s decision in this regard. Management can concentrate efforts on improvement of service, keeping in mind these priorities.\n\n\nObjective\nYou as a Data scientist with the bank need to build a neural network based classifier that can determine whether a customer will leave the bank or not in the next 6 months.\n\n\nData Dictionary\n\nCustomerId: Unique ID which is assigned to each customer\nSurname: Last name of the customer\nCreditScore: It defines the credit history of the customer.\nGeography: A customer’s location\nGender: It defines the Gender of the customer\nAge: Age of the customer\nTenure: Number of years for which the customer has been with the bank\nNumOfProducts: refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.\nBalance: Account balance\nHasCrCard: It is a categorical variable which decides whether the customer has credit card or not.\nEstimatedSalary: Estimated salary\nisActiveMember: Is is a categorical variable which decides whether the customer is active member of the bank or not ( Active member in the sense, using bank products regularly, making transactions etc )\nExited : whether or not the customer left the bank within six month. It can take two values ** 0=No ( Customer did not leave the bank ) ** 1=Yes ( Customer left the bank )\n\n\nfrom google.colab import drive\ndrive.mount('/content/drive')\n\nDrive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True)."

more at risk.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(5,5))\nsns.boxplot(y='Balance',x='Exited',data=data, palette=\"Set1\")\nplt.title(\"Balance Distribution by Churn Status (Exited)\",

customers have a balance of 0 in both groups, but more so among those who stayed.\nThe upper whisker and outliers suggest some churned customers held substantially higher balances.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(5,5))\nsns.boxplot(y='EstimatedSalary',x='Exited',data=data, palette=\"Set3\")\nplt.title(\"Estimated Salary Distribution by Churn Status (Exited)\",

strong outlier trends or distinct differences in salary ranges between the two.\nThis indicates that EstimatedSalary has minimal influence on churn in this dataset.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(5,5))\nsns.boxplot(y='Tenure',x='Exited',data=data,palette=\"Set1\")\nplt.title(\"Tenure Distribution by Churn Status (Exited)\", fontsize=13)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe median tenure is similar for both churned and retained customers.\nCustomers who exited show slightly more spread in tenure.\nNo strong relationship is visually evident — churn happens across all tenure levels.\nThis suggests tenure alone may not be a strong predictor of churn, but it could interact with other features like age or number of products.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(5,5))\nsns.boxplot(y='NumOfProducts',x='Exited',data=data,palette='Set2')\nplt.title(\"Number of Products Distribution by Churn Status (Exited)\", fontsize=13)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost customers have 1 or 2 products, regardless of churn status.\nCustomers with 4 products are almost exclusively churned, suggesting that higher product count may correlate with dissatisfaction."
